# PyBalanceBook : Plain text accounting for spreadsheet

## ðŸš§ This is a work in progress ðŸš§

BalanceBook is a Python library that bridges the gap between plain text
financial data and spreadsheet software such as Excel. It simplifies complex
financial computations that can be challenging to perform directly in Excel,
providing pre-computed data for a seamless and efficient financial management
experience in Excel.

Its main features are :
- Double entry accounting.
- Importing new transactions from csv files and deduplication.
- All data stored as CSV files. Easily modifiable in your favorite spreadsheet
  software and version control friendly.
- Strict data integrity enforcement.

PyBalanceBook is tailored to my worflow. For general purpose plain text accouting
software see [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org), [hledger](https://hledger.org) or
[beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount).
