# PyBalanceBook : Plain text accounting with budgeting in mind

## ðŸš§ This is a work in progress ðŸš§

PyBalanceBook is a plain text accounting python library. It is not a software but
a toolbox to write python scripts.

Its main features are :
- Double entry accounting.
- Importing transactions from csv files.
- Budgeting.
- All data stored as CSV files. Easily modifiable in your favorite spreadsheet
  program and version control friendly.
- Strict data integrity enforcement.

PyBalanceBook is tailored to my worflow. For general purpose plain text accouting
software see [ledger](https://ledger-cli.org), [hledger](https://hledger.org) or
[beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount).
